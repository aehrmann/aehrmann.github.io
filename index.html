          <h2>Concept</h2>
          <p>This project is a creative exploration of the number Pi as data
            source for producing tones in the browser.
          </p>

          <section class="overview">
            <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><a
                  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API">
                  HTML5 Web Audio API</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a></li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="description">
            <h2>How It Works </h2>
            <p>The project uses the digits of Pi as indices into a list of 10
              frequency values, corresponding to the notes C4 - D4. As the
              digits are animated, the current digit is used to grab the
              frequency at that position in the list, which is then used to
              update the oscillator's frequency.
            </p>
            <p>
              While the Web Audio API handles the production of the tones
              themselves, Angular manages the controls. Using two-way binding,
              the controller can update the status of the sounds
              (playing/paused), reset the playhead, and update the duration of
              the notes.
            </p>

            <h2>Future Plans</h2>

            <p>
              Right now, the project has several limitations, including
              a limited set of notes and the manner in which the notes are
              played. In future iterations, I plan to add a way to choose
              different sets of notes to play, most likely different scales
              and a greater range of octaves.  </p>

            <p>
              On the audio side, modifications to how the tones are actually
              produced could be
              improved. Right now, the simplest way to update the oscillator's
              frequency is to mute it, adjust the frequency, and then unmute.
              This has the side effect of making the notes sounds continuous.
              The goal for the next version would be to add a small gap of
              silence between the notes.
            </p>

            <p>
              I also plan to add ways to select the format of the speed of the
              notes, adding an option to set the interval in the form of
              beats-per-minute, according to the way most audio applications
              work.
            </p>

            <p>
              Another idea for an extension is the ability to loop a specific
              selection of notes. This would allow the user to investigate
              sub-patterns within the digits of Pi.

            <h1>AptAmigo</h1>
          </header>


          <section class="overview">
            <h2>Concept</h2>
            <p>As part of Startup Institute&#39;s partner project, I served as
              my team&#39;s project manager and assisted with the design and
              development of the project. Our partner, AptAmigo, is
              a Chicago-based startup, developing a platform for apartment
              rentals and condo purchases, providing real reviews from
              previous tenants. </p>
          </section>

          <section class="description">
            <h2>Initial Direction</h2>
            <p>Dan Willenbourg, AptAmigo&#39;s founder, came to us with the
              initial goals of redesigning portions of the site to increase
              conversion rates, developing a customer relationship management
              system (CRM) to automate their then manual process, and develop
              and execute a marketing plan to propel AptAmigo forward.</p>
            <p>For the first phase of the project, I worked with <a
                href="http://robinmckay.co/">Robin McKay</a>, a talented
              designer, researching effective landing page designs and
              usability improvements to the platform, in the hopes of
              decreasing bounce rates and increasing conversion rates.</p>

            <h2>The Pivot</h2>
            <p>About halfway through the project, AptAmigo&#39;s traffic had
              grown quickly and steadily enough that the bounce and conversion
              rates were no longer the issues they started as, and deisgn and
              development efforts shifted to making sure certain parts of the
              were as usable as possible to retain the new customers AptAmigo
              was attracting.</p>
            <p>My team wanted to provide the same amoutn of value that
              we&#39;d initially planned, so Robin and I shifted our focus to
              streamlining the content already on the site and presented
              functional protytpes of propsed modifications to its layout and
              minor tweaks to colors and typography.</p>
            <p>Being on a tight deadline, and becuase of difficulty
              communicating with Dan&#39;s remote development team in Utah,
              I scraped the home page and <a
                href="https://www.aptamigo.com/IL/Chicago/Apartment/optima-chicago-center">one
                of the property listing pages</a> so that I could develop and
              modify the designs. I also set up a <a
                href="http://aptamigo-prototypes.herokuapp.com/">Node.js-based
                static site on Heroku</a> so that Dan and I could communicate
              about the changes I was making as close to real-time as
              possible. </p>

            <h2>The Result</h2>
            <p>Although the pivot changed the nature of the final deliverables
              for the project as a whole, we were able to provide Dan with
              a direction for design, producing tangible products in the form
              of functional and styled prototypes that the development team
              could use to update the production site.</p>
